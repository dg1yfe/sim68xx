<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">DESCRIPTION </A></H2>
Each of 
these simulators simulate CPU, memory and on chip IO for its architecture. 
A monitor that resembles a typical ROM boot monitor is available to control 
execution of the CPU, and to examine states of CPU, memory and IO. <P>
  All 
simulators have 64K memory available for user programs. A more detailed 
description of each simulator follows. 
<DL>

<DT>   <I>sim6301 </I> </DT>
<DD>    Simulator for 6800, 
6801 and 6301. The 6301 instruction set is a superset of the 6801, and 
the 6801 instruction set is a superset of the 6800. The simulator is modeled 
after the 6801/6301V/6303R chips, with interrupt driven SCI and timer 
output compare.  </DD>

<DT>   <I>sim6805 </I> </DT>
<DD>    Simulator for 68hc05c series. Interrupt 
driven SCI, SPI and timer is simulated. The simulation of SCI and SPI is 
borrowed from sim6811.  </DD>

<DT>   <I>sim6811 </I> </DT>
<DD>    Simulator for 68hc11 series, which 
is a superset of 6801, and different from 6301. Interrupt driven SCI, SPI 
and timer output compare 1 is supported.    When the simulator is started, 
it will try to load files in the following order. </DD>

<DT>   Program file </DT>
<DD>    This 
file must be on S19 format and given as argument when the simulator is 
started.  </DD>

<DT>   Symbol file </DT>
<DD>    The symbol file contains value to string conversion 
information, and one of the following files is loaded, if it exists.  The 
file must have extension <I>.map </I> or <I>.sym </I>.  If the extension is <I>.map </I>, it is 
expected to have <I>Baldwin aslink </I> format, i.e.  an ascii file containing 
lines of a hexadecimal value followed by a string.  If the extension is 
<I>.sym </I>, it is assumed to have <I>Motorola freeware asm </I> format, i.e.  an ascii 
file containing lines of a string followed by a hexadecimal value.  </DD>

<DT>   
Command file </DT>
<DD>    If a file with extension <I>.sim </I> exists, it will be used 
as a command file. If no such file exists, the simulator will try to open 
the file <I>.simrc </I> (or <I>sim.rc </I> under MSDOS). The simulator will read and execute 
commands from a command file, if found, as they had been present on standard 
input, until the end of the command file is reached.   A simulator is most 
useful when target is not available for some reason, or there is limited 
or cumbersome debug support on target.  </DD>

<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">USAGE </A></H2>
The following is a summary 
of user commands supported. For more details, refer to the help text in 
the simulator. <P>
      Set/clear program breakpoints in the program code 
and on execution error     Modification and display of memory and CPU 
registers     Run, step over subroutines and trace (single step) instructions. 
A running program can be aborted any time by interrupt from the user.  
    Simple support for global symbols

<P>
  
<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7">HISTORY </A></H2>
The first simulator was written by the author for 6301 in single 
chip mode early in 1993, with to little space to have debug support in 
the ROM. Wrote this using Turbo C/DOS and later ported it to gcc/Linux. 
Did some performance tests that favoured gcc/Linux with a factor of 10. 
Added support for 6805 and later for 6811 in 1994. New directory structure 
to ease maintenance, and added test suite for the 6800 core, in 1995. Compiled 
with Turbo C/DOS, gcc/Linux and cc/gcc/Solaris. Optimized code for inlining 
early 1996 which doubled the speed.  <P>

<H2><A NAME="sect9" HREF="#toc9">BUGS </A></H2>
<P>
      There are no known bugs in the execution of opcodes.     There 
is only support for one IO area.     There is only support for global symbols. 
    There is no support for different types of memory other than 64K RAM. 
    There is no easy-to-use window based user interface.  <P>
