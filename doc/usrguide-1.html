<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Features</A></H2>


<P>
<UL>
<LI>Simulation of 6801/6301, 6805, and 6811 series processors
</LI>
<LI> ROM like monitor with one/two character commands (Motorola style)</LI>
<LI> Breakpoints in code and data</LI>
<LI> Disassembler</LI>
<LI> Global symbol table (formats generated by ASLINK and FASM)</LI>
<LI> On chip I/O partially simulated (SCI, SPI, single timer output
compare)</LI>
<LI> 64K memory model</LI>
<LI> Easy for user to add  code simulating IO peripherals. A couple
of examples included (including an I2C like device, Xicor X9241).</LI>
<LI> Runs many example test programs, including monitors. A rather
comprehensive 6800 test program from the 6800 user group archive on
Motorolas FTP site (http://www.mot.com/sps/mcu/usrgroup) has been
successfully run on the simulator. 
</LI>
<LI> Performance. When compiled with gcc and inlining, the simulator
runs at
<UL>
<LI>486DX33 w/64kb cache</LI>
<LI> 0.15 the speed of an 8Mhz 6811 (2Mhz internal clock)</LI>
<LI> 0.4 the speed of an 2.4576 Mhz 6301 (0.6144 Mhz internal clock)</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Pentium 133</LI>
<LI> 0.5 the speed of an 8Mhz 6811 (2Mhz internal clock)</LI>
<LI> 1.0 the speed of an 2.4576 Mhz 6301 (0.6144 Mhz internal clock)</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Future</A></H2>


<P>The following is a list of features that may be added to sim68xx in
the future.</P>

<H3>Graphical window user interface</H3>

<P>Candidates to concider:
<UL>
<LI> Tcl/Tk (tksim68xx). Will run under Unix, MS Windows and
Mac. Windows and commands have already been designed using the
vtcl GUI builder (vtcl). </LI>
<LI> Java AWT (jsim68xx). Standalone or applet. Will run on
Unix, MS Windows, OS/2 and Mac.</LI>
<LI> WxWindows. Will run under Unix, MS Windows and Mac.</LI>
<LI> V. Will run under Unix, MS Windows (later OS/2 and Mac)</LI>
<LI> YACL. Will run under Unix, MS Windows, OS/2 and Mac.</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H3>Character window user interface</H3>

<P>Candidates to concider:
<UL>
<LI> Xview (sim68xxtool). Will run under Unix variants
supporting Open Windows, for example Sun, Linux, AT&amp;T.</LI>
<LI> Turbo Vision (tvsim68xx). Will run under MSDOS, OS/2 and
Unix (at least Linux), but not native MS Windows.</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<H3>Symbolic C debugging</H3>


<P>This requires that symbol and line number information is available,
either in the executable file or in a separate file. Which symbol
format that will be supported, has to be defined. The ASLINK and FASM
assemblers that are support global symbols only.</P>

<P>Remote debugging, where the simulator communicates with a
symbolic debugger over a serial line (simulated or real line), is
another possible solution. It is quite attractive in the way that the
debugger is completely independent of the simulator. The GNU debugger,
GDB, for example, has defined a protocol to debug using a serial
line. GDB can use this protocol to read from and write to memory
adresses.</P>


<H3>Dynamic Linking for simulating on-chip and external IO</H3>


<P>The current design requires that code for simulating IO is separately
compiled, and statically linked into the executable, even though the
simulator calls the IO through a function pointer.</P>





<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Revision history</A></H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>1996-08-03/AR. Created document skeleton.</LI>
<LI>1996-08-03/AR. Wrote IO chapters with unfinished example.</LI>
<LI>1999-08-20/AR. Completed. Collected info from many small files.</LI>
</UL>
